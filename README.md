Implementation of an artificial intelligence to play and solve the game Misére-Nim

The following work deals with the implementation of an artificial intelligence to solve the game Misére-Nim. Using reinforcement learning and the Q-learning algorithm, profitable moves are entered, recognised and executed in a dynamically forming Q-table. The implementation of a graphical user interface represents an interface for a game between humans and AI, which is implemented with pygame. 

mn_RL_MAIN.py = main game with trained ai

mn_RL_QTABLE.py = training of qtable

final_qtable_mn.txt = final qtable and results

mn_environment_NPC.py = Misére-Nim game between a human player and a npc that simulates the winning strategy of Misére-Nim

mn_env_HUMAN.py = Misére-Nim game between two human players with user interface

mn_gamelogic.py = Misére-Nim game between two human players in terminal 

Button.py = Button class used for the tokens
