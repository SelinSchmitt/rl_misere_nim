Implementation of an artificial intelligence to play and solve the game Misére-Nim

The following work deals with the implementation of an artificial intelligence to solve the game Misére-Nim. Using reinforcement learning and the Q-learning algorithm, profitable moves are entered, recognised and executed in a dynamically forming Q-table. The implementation of a graphical user interface represents an interface for a game between humans and AI, which is implemented here. The development of a non-player character leads to an incremental development of an artificial intelligence.
